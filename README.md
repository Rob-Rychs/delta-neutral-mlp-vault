# delta-neutral-mlp-vault
A prototype of a trading vault strategy that benefits from the MLP index APY while attempting to be delta neutral to the composite tokens 

Ideas how to build/integrate this: 
-play with the % of the standard mlp index
-look into combining or allocating a % of the tokens into liquidity minning of whatever token(s) are currently trading at a discount to a 200MA BB
-look into offering variable MLP indexes, historic price/weight ratios, side pools?
